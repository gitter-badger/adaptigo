### Plugin structure


Plugins can be placed under ~/.local/share/Adaptigo/plugins/, or the system plugins directory.

Each plugin is a directory with the suffix .plugin, which consist of a JSON formatted metadata file. The metadata file contains information about the plugin and describes how Fedy should run the tasks.

The plugins can run any command or scripts (bash, python etc.). In addtion to the system commands, Fedy provides an additional command, run-as-root to allow running commands (e.g.- run-as-root touch /some/file/somewhere) or scripts (e.g.- run-as-root -s do-stuff.sh) as root.

Have a look at the existing plugins to know more about how to write plugins for Fedy.
