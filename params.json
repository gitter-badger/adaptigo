The metadata file contains information about the plugin and describes how Fedy should run the tasks.\r\n\r\nThe plugins can run any command or scripts (bash, python etc.). In addtion to the system commands, Fedy provides an additional command, run-as-root to allow running commands (e.g.- run-as-root touch /some/file/somewhere) or scripts (e.g.- run-as-root -s do-stuff.sh) as root.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the existing plugins to know more about how to write plugins for Fedy.\r\nSource code\r\n\r\nYou can get the latest source code from the github page.\r\n\r\ngit clone git@github.com:xpd259/debbie.git\r\n\r\n### Bugs and feature requests\r\n\r\nPlease submit bugs and feature requests here.
